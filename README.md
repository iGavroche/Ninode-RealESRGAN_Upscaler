# Preface

<p align="justify">This node uses the RealESRGAN model from
xinntao [1]. This is my personal favourite upscaling model and 
upscaling approach.</p>

## Whats New

<p align="justify">Yesterday I added a bunch of things to the node.
Now the node is a little bit more complicated than before. On the 
other hand side the node considers now everything which is possible
to do with the node.</p>

## Upscaling

<p align="justify">One can set the scaling factor in steps of 0.1
in the node. For the moment there is no known limit for the scaling
factor. I used for example an unrealistic scaling factor of 30.0 
for upscaling of a test image. The limiting factor is in this case 
the size of the image file.</p>

## Installation

<p align="justify">Use the ComfyUI Manager for the installation. Use my nick 'zentrocdot' or for 
'ComfyUI_realESRGAN_Upscaler'</p>

## Bug Fixing

in the directory is a file called fix.bash. This can be used to fix
the bug in the Python package.

## Error Screen

### Preliminary Note

If you see an error screen which looks like the one below this is still intended as a possibility at present.

![Bildschirmfoto vom 2025-02-09 08-57-01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03771469-3a59-4115-baba-a362b60d20fb)

<p><i>Figure 2: Error message preview</i></p>

<p align="justify">The error is easy to explain. Since I opened the
upscaler node for other models than the given ones there may be collisions 
in the parameter settings. This error means that one is using a different
netscale to the one the models needs. In the most of the models there will
be a x2, x4 or x8 and then it is easy to use the right netscale. If there
is no note in the filename to the netscale one needs to guess about the 
right one.</p> 

### General Remark

<p align="justify">While presenting how the node works I figured out a new 
problem. I was able to mess up my system so badly by setting an incorrect 
value for netscale that nothing worked at all. Conclusion is, that I have 
to catch the error, even though I didn't really want to.</p> 

## Limitations

## To-Do

<p align="justify">There are a plenty of things to to</p>

## Credits

<p align="justify">Special credits goes to xinntao (Xintao Wang) for his excellent 
work on ESRGAN and RealESRGAN models The results achieved are quite impressive.</p> 

## Final Words

Have fun. Be inspired!
