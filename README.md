# Preface

<p align="justify">This node uses the RealESRGAN model from
xinntao [1]. This is my personal favourite upscaling model and 
upscaling approach.</p>

## Upscaling

On can set the scaling factor is steps of 0.1. There is for the
moment no limit for the scaling factor. I scaled a testimage up
with a factor of 30.0.
