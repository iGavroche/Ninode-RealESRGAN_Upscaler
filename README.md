# Preface

<p align="justify">This node uses the RealESRGAN model from
xinntao [1]. This is my personal favourite upscaling model and 
upscaling approach.</p>

## Upscaling

<p align="justify">One can set the scaling factor in steps of 0.1
in the node. For the moment there is no known limit for the scaling
factor. I used for example an unrealistic scaling factor of 30.0 
for upscaling of a test image. The limiting factor is in this case 
the size of the image file.</p>
