# Preface

<p align="justify">This node uses the RealESRGAN model from
xinntao [1]. This is my personal favourite upscaling model and 
upscaling approach.</p>

## Upscaling

<p align="justify">One can set the scaling factor in steps of 0.1
in the node. For the moment there is no known limit for the scaling
factor. I used for example an unrealistic scaling factor of 30.0 
for upscaling of a test image. The limiting factor is in this case 
the size of the image file.</p>

## Error Screen

If you see an error screen which looks like the one below this is still intended as a possibility at present.

<p><i>Figure 2: Error message preview</i></p>

<p align="justify">The error is easy to explain. Since I opened the
upscaler node for other models than the given ones there may be collisions 
in the parameter settings. This error means that one is using a different
netscale to the one the models needs. In the most of the models there will
be a x2, x4 or x8 and then it is easy to use the right netscale. If there
is no note in the filename to the netscale one needs to guess about the 
right one.</p> 

## Final Words

Have fun. Be inspired!
